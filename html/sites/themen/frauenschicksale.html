This subject is often the foundation for great stories. If it is the story of
            <a href="https://amzn.to/3WX3JlV">Christiane F.</a>
            or of <a href="https://amzn.to/3KgnHkj">Betty Mahmoody</a>. The stories
            of these women have moved millions and I also adore those stories
            and have often succeeded.
            Corinne Hofmanns book <a href="https://amzn.to/3WRhTVU"></a>"the white massai" is very
            well known as well as the 2 books that followed.
            (<a href="https://amzn.to/455FlRq">"back from
            africa"</a><a href="https://amzn.to/3Xghs7V">"meeting again in barsaloi"</a></p>
            which I also qualified as pageturners. I just realized that she has
            published other titles as well so I add these to my <a href="sites/autoren/hofmann" wishlist</a>.
            Another title that I remember very well is Mende Nazers <a href="https://amzn.to/4bV8O2E">"slave"</a>
            Waris Diries <a href="https://amzn.to/3yzoJFj">"desert flower"</a></p> is also a classic in this genre.
            Her books have all qualified as pageturner see here which other books of her I have read already.
            Saphia Azzadines book <a href="https://amzn.to/3UPYBgY">"prayers of rage"</a></p> is or was at least for
            me lesser known and by coincidence i found this title and enjoyed it. Great read.
            Another book of this area which i just started i also till now qualified as a pageturner
            Djura <a href="https://amzn.to/4bRcYse">"the veil of silence"</a> A great read again. Looking forward to
            the rest of the book.

                <p class="float-right"><a href="../allgemein/impressum.html">disclaimer/impressum</a>
        One of my discoveries in 2023 was ebadi <a href="https://amzn.to/4bzEomQ">my iran</a>. Another great book about
            a woman with a mission.
