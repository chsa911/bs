    <h5 id="heax" style="text-align: center">What drives me to use such a reading technique?</h5>
    <p>
        Already as a young boy I liked to read a lot favorably Karl May.
        Later on I lost this passion or rather time?
        One day I discovered this <a href="drei_l.html">revolutionary
        technique</a> and I got into
        reading again as I could use every minute to read.
        I am driven also, to read only good stories.
        This technique also came into play and enabled it as I can carry
        always a lot of books and never have the risk to have only bad ones.

        The missing capability to return from books shops and peddlars
        markets without heaps of books
        stimulated this approach.

        In the end to try it once changed my whole life as I
        always had my book with me since then.

        I hope you get the point...
