    <h5 style="text-align: center"> How to find pageturners part 2 what to buy</h5>
    <p style="text-align: center">
    I use a trial and error approach to find pageturners. This is very easily done
    by carrying parts of books in a bag and read in a train till I have found one.
    This creates surprises which I love and I also discover books from ages ago which
    are great though.<p> But there are other strategies.<p>
    If you go to a bookstore with qualified personnel they will recommend you
    a good book and you are done. You save a lot of time. But you usually get only
    topical books. No older ones, which are not worse in quality.<p>
    Another legitimate strategy is the "buy bestsellers strategy". This will be also
    the one qualified personnel in bookstores will use. One prominent example is the
    <a href="https://www.spiegel.de/kultur/bestseller-
    buecher-belletristik-sachbuch-auf-spiegel-liste-a-458623.html">spiegel
        bestsellerlist</a> it
    is legitimate and also giving you good
    results but you also get just topical books. Books have been there for ages and a big part
    of this resource will be left out.
    Another strategy that I also follow is reading by authors.<p> This can be very successful
    especially in the case of some of my favorite authors like Konsalik who created
    119 bestsellers means million sellers in his life!!! I have gotten many pageturners from him.
    See in my most read authors <a href="/sites/allgemein/autoren_meistgelesen.html">page</a> .
    I follow and document this strategy on my <a href="/allgmein/autoren_fokus.html"> page</a> so
   you can follow me and in the best case also get pageturners.<p>
        A relative new strategy I follow is the "read by subjects" one which I also document on
        <a href="/sites/allgemein/leseexpeditionen.html"> my readingexpeditions </a> page. My first one
        is the disaster 1996 on Mount Everest.<p>
        With all these strategies and all modern amenities you might ask why I
        don't use an ebook reader and this question I answer here <a href="/sites/allgemein/ebook.html">
