            <p  style="width: 1000px; text-align: center">
There are two areas to this question: Where to buy and how to decide what to buy.
The 1. area is easily answered.
                There are bookshops in many cities and also online.
                I think the best way to find pageturners is in bookshops with a big choice
                and the possibility of advice by qualified sales personnel and trial.
                I recommend here in munich where I live the Hugendubel book shop where I
                spent many hours reading so I could decide which books to buy.</p>
                But bookshops are also in airports and train stations. Here you also usually can
                try and find a great book.
                In online bookshops you can also trial read and read recensions: It takes more time
                though so I recommend the local bookshop, except you want to buy used. But there
                are shops in some cities also.<p> I usually buy at Antiquariat
                Angelika Ziegler Landsberger Str. 71 80339 Munich. Big choice and nice personnel.
                But for sure there are others
                If you should be more engaged you might like me visit peddlars markets
                which can be an interesting experience and a good source for new books
                and inspiration. Here I find the base for my trial and error
