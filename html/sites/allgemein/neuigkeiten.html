        Whats new?</h1>
    05\22\24 Follow my new Mount Everest 1996 challenge. This catastrophe till
    today evokes emotions and Jon Krakauers book "Into thin air" got me hooked.
    See this very interesting video
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jL9UHk1zTeY&t=3303s">
    of Neadle Beidlman </a>the only surviving member of the expedition that hasn t written
    a book. This got me the idea
    to start a challenge. Read all books of members of
    this expedition. Read details here <p href="/leseaufgabe.html">
</p>
    <p>
05\\24 I will now add links on my discovery page to bookstores where you can
    purchase the books suggested and also get further information.
    I will also get a small commission that helps me to keep the site up.

        04\24\24 I opend a new tiktok account the bookswiper
        to promote my method better. I can so post more videos.
    </p>
        04\02\24 I am using my bed as a book store due to problems with construction.
        The slatted frame always broke down so I couldn t use the bed.
        Now I put a row of books below the frame and so it doesn t fall
        down. The books saved my sleep. Great idea and solution as I can store more books.
    <p>

        02\13\24 I am writing a reading diary on my discoveries page to show you my
        reading live and to let me remember the books I
        discover everyday. Stay tuned and get to know great books.
    </p>
        31\12\23 I am reorganizing my bookshelf to read more and faster so I am
        pretty busy getting rid of my books as you
        might have discovered on my youtube channel.
    <p>
        Its done I could reorganize my bookshelf
        <img src="/assets/images/buecherschrank_reorganisation.jpeg" width="20%"
             height="300" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
        You can can see that only a small compartment is filled
        with books to read and the rest is full of new books to be prepared.
        So it helps me to focus on a few books and to
        enjoy more and select and dispose of faster..
