Whats new?</h1>
04\24\24 I opend a new tiktok account the bookswiper to promote my method better. I can so post more videos.    
04\02\24 I am using my bed as a book store due to problems with construction. The slatted frame always broke down so I couldn t use the bed. Now I put a row of books below the frame and so it doesn t fall down. The books saved my sleep. Great idea and solution as I can store more books. 


02\13\24 I am writing a reading diary on my discoveries page to show you my reading live and to let me remember the books I discover everyday. Stay tuned and get to know great books.
<p>
31\12\23 I am reorganizing my bookshelf to read more and faster so I am 
pretty busy getting rid of my books as you 
might have discovered on my youtube channel.

Its done I could reorganize my bookshelf
<img src="/assets/images/bookshelf_reorganisation.jpeg" width="20%" height="300" class="rounded mx-auto d-block">
You can can see that only a small compartment is filled with books to read and the rest is full of new books to be prepared. 
So it helps me to focus on a few books and to enjoy more and select and dispose of faster..

<h3 class="news">New Commentary function on the discoveries page. You can now leave a comment about books that I discovered or about content you want to see on my site.
