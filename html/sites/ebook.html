            <h1>Why no ebook reader or smartphone?</h1>
            <p>
E-Book readers and smartphones allow us to access almost all books worldwide in no time. You can
                ususally trial read and swipe from one to another to best practice the
                trial and error strategy I described
                on my <a href="/sites/strategie.html">strategy</a> page. They are often
                small and need relative few space. But can you sit on  them e.g. when you carry
                them in your wallet pocket of your trousers?
                Can you carry them without hassle in your front pocket?  No and there we go.
                My strategy is made for the small area of your trousers and jackets which should
                not bulge and it should be light in the hand and work without energy.

                I also like the look and feel of paper.

                There is no distraction (especially important with smartphones) and a large
                content pool larger than electronic readers. Not all books have
                been transferred to digital.
                This pool via "used bookstores" and peddlarsmarkets
                can be accessed for a small price.

                One practical aspect not to be neglected when travelling is: safety.
                My paperbooks are absolutely safe of theft even in the most dangerous environment
                and can be relatively easily replaced.
